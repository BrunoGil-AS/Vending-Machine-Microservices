# Vending Machine Microservices - Project Flow Guide

---

## System Overview

The Vending Machine Control System is a microservices-based application built with Spring Boot, implementing a complete purchase flow from product selection to item dispensing. The system uses both synchronous (REST) and asynchronous (Kafka) communication patterns to ensure data consistency and system reliability.

### Architecture Highlights

- **8 Microservices**: Config, Eureka, Gateway, Inventory, Payment, Transaction, Dispensing, Notification
- **Communication**: Hybrid approach - Synchronous HTTP for real-time transactions, Asynchronous Kafka for updates
- **Database**: MySQL with database-per-service pattern (8 separate databases)
- **Security**: JWT-based authentication at API Gateway level with RBAC
- **Service Discovery**: Eureka Server for dynamic service registration
- **Configuration**: Centralized Config Server with file-based properties

---

## Business Logic Flow

### Complete Purchase Flow

```plaintext
1. Customer selects product â†’ API Gateway
2. Gateway routes to Transaction Service
3. Transaction Service checks inventory availability (Synchronous REST call to Inventory Service)
4. If available, Transaction Service processes payment (Synchronous REST call to Payment Service)
5. Payment Service validates payment and publishes payment-completed event to Kafka
6. Transaction Service consumes payment event and requests dispensing (Synchronous REST call to Dispensing Service)
7. Dispensing Service simulates item dispensing and publishes dispensing-completed event to Kafka
8. Inventory Service consumes dispensing event and updates stock levels
9. If stock falls below threshold, Inventory Service publishes low-stock-alert event
10. Notification Service consumes all events and stores notifications for admin review
11. Transaction Service updates transaction status to COMPLETED
12. Customer receives confirmation response
```

### Failure Scenarios

#### Insufficient Stock

- Transaction Service receives "not available" response from Inventory Service
- Transaction status set to FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STOCK
- Customer receives immediate error response
- No payment processing initiated

#### Payment Failure

- Payment Service publishes payment-failed event to Kafka
- Transaction Service consumes event and updates status to FAILED_PAYMENT
- No dispensing initiated
- Customer receives payment failure notification

#### Dispensing Failure

- Dispensing Service publishes dispensing-failed event to Kafka
- Transaction Service consumes event and updates status to FAILED_DISPENSING
- Compensation: Stock levels NOT reduced (event not published)
- Notification Service alerts admin for manual intervention
- Customer receives dispensing failure notification

## Kafka Event Flow

### Topic Architecture

| Topic               | Partitions | Replication | Producers            | Consumers                                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| transaction-events  | 1          | 1           | Transaction Service  | Payment Service, Dispensing Service, Notification Service    |
| payment-events      | 1          | 1           | Payment Service      | Transaction Service, Notification Service                    |
| inventory-events    | 1          | 1           | Inventory Service    | Notification Service                                         |
| dispensing-events   | 1          | 1           | Dispensing Service   | Inventory Service, Transaction Service, Notification Service |

### Event Schemas

All events follow a standard structure with correlation IDs for tracing:

```json
{
  "eventId": "uuid",
  "eventType": "EVENT_TYPE_ENUM",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "correlationId": "transaction-uuid",
  "payload": {
    // Event-specific data
  }
}
```

### Producer-Consumer Relationships

#### Transaction Events

- **Producer**: Transaction Service
- **Events**: `transaction.created`, `transaction.completed`, `transaction.failed`
- **Consumers**:
  - Payment Service: Listens for `transaction.created` to initiate payment
  - Dispensing Service: Listens for `transaction.completed` (alternative flow)
  - Notification Service: Logs all transaction events

#### Payment Events

- **Producer**: Payment Service
- **Events**: `payment.initiated`, `payment.completed`, `payment.failed`
- **Consumers**:
  - Transaction Service: Updates transaction status based on payment outcome
  - Notification Service: Logs payment events and generates admin alerts on failures

#### Inventory Events

- **Producer**: Inventory Service
- **Events**: `stock.updated`, `stock.low`, `product.added`
- **Consumers**:
  - Notification Service: Generates low stock alerts for admin dashboard

#### Dispensing Events

- **Producer**: Dispensing Service
- **Events**: `dispensing.requested`, `dispensing.completed`, `dispensing.failed`
- **Consumers**:
  - Inventory Service: Updates stock quantities after successful dispensing
  - Transaction Service: Updates transaction status
  - Notification Service: Logs dispensing operations and alerts on failures

#### Notification Events

- **Producer**: Notification Service
- **Events**: `notification.created`, `notification.sent`
- **Consumers**: Future integrations (Email, SMS, Push notifications)

### Event Processing Guarantees

- **Delivery Semantics**: At-least-once delivery
- **Idempotency**: All consumers use `ProcessedEvent` table to prevent duplicate processing
- **Event Ordering**: Single partition per topic ensures order within topic
- **Failure Handling**: Dead letter queue pattern for failed event processing (to be implemented)

## REST API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints (No Authentication Required)

#### Inventory Service REST API

- `GET /api/inventory/products` - List all available products
- `GET /api/inventory/availability/{productId}` - Check product availability

#### Transaction Service REST API

- `POST /api/transaction/purchase` - Initiate purchase transaction

  ```json
  {
    "productId": 1,
    "quantity": 1,

    "paidAmount": 2.5
  }
  ```

#### Payment Service API

- `POST /api/payment/process` - Process payment (called by Transaction Service)

### Protected Endpoints (JWT Authentication Required)

#### API Gateway - Authentication

- `POST /api/auth/login` - Admin login (returns JWT token)

  ```json
  {
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "password"
  }
  ```

- `POST /api/admin/users` - Create admin user (SUPER_ADMIN only)
- `GET /api/admin/users` - List all users (ADMIN)
- `PUT /api/admin/users/{id}` - Update user (SUPER_ADMIN only)
- `DELETE /api/admin/users/{id}` - Delete user (SUPER_ADMIN only)

#### Inventory Service

---

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Token Flow

1. Admin submits credentials to `POST /api/auth/login`
2. API Gateway validates credentials against MySQL database
3. Gateway generates JWT token with 8-hour expiry containing:
   - User ID
   - Username
   - Role (SUPER_ADMIN or ADMIN)
4. Token returned to client: `{"token": "eyJhbG...", "expiresIn": 28800}`
5. Client includes token in subsequent requests: `Authorization: Bearer {token}`
6. Gateway validates token on each request and adds user context headers
7. Business services trust headers from gateway (no authentication logic in services)

### Role-Based Access Control

#### SUPER_ADMIN Role

- Full system access
- User management (create, update, delete admin users)
- All admin operations
- Cannot be deleted by other users

#### ADMIN Role

- Inventory management
- Transaction monitoring
- Payment monitoring
- Dispensing control
- Notification management
- Cannot create other users

### User Context Propagation

Gateway adds these headers to all authenticated requests:

- `X-User-Id`: Authenticated user's database ID
- `X-User-Role`: User's role (SUPER_ADMIN or ADMIN)
- `X-Username`: Username for audit logging

Business services read these headers for:

- Audit logging (who performed the action)
- Business logic decisions (if needed)
- Correlation with transaction data

## System Startup Order

**Critical**: Services must start in this order to ensure proper configuration and registration.

1. **MySQL Server** (Port 3306) - Must be running with all databases created
2. **Zookeeper** (Port 2181) - Required for Kafka
3. **Kafka Broker** (Port 9092) - Message broker
4. **Config Server** (Port 8888) - Configuration provider
5. **Eureka Server** (Port 8761) - Service registry
6. **Business Services** (Parallel start possible):
   - Inventory Service (Port 8081)
   - Payment Service (Port 8082)
   - Transaction Service (Port 8083)
   - Dispensing Service (Port 8084)
   - Notification Service (Port 8085)
7. **API Gateway** (Port 8080) - Entry point (starts last to ensure all services registered)

### Health Checks

All services expose health endpoints via Spring Boot Actuator:

- `http://localhost:{port}/actuator/health`
- Includes database connectivity, Kafka connectivity, and service-specific health indicators

### Service Discovery Dashboard

Eureka dashboard available at: `http://localhost:8761`

- Shows all registered services
- Service status and health
- Instance information

## Performance Characteristics

### Response Time Targets

- **API Response Time**: < 2000ms under normal load
- **Event Processing Time**: < 100ms for Kafka event consumption
- **Database Query Time**: < 500ms for database operations
- **Service Startup Time**: < 120 seconds per service

### Throughput Targets

- **Concurrent Transactions**: 10-50 simultaneous purchases
- **Event Throughput**: 1000+ events per minute
- **Database Connections**: 20+ concurrent connections per service
- **API Request Rate**: 100+ requests per minute

### Resource Requirements

- **Memory**: 6GB RAM minimum for all services
- **CPU**: Normal operations < 70% utilization
- **Disk**: 2GB free space for logs and data
- **Network**: Localhost communication sufficient

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### Logging Strategy

- **Structured Logging**: All services use SLF4J with Logback
- **Correlation IDs**: Track requests across service boundaries
- **Log Levels**: INFO for business operations, DEBUG for troubleshooting, ERROR for failures
- **Log Files**: Separate log file per service in `logs/` directory

### Metrics Collection

Spring Boot Actuator exposes:

- `/actuator/metrics` - JVM and application metrics
- `/actuator/prometheus` - Prometheus-formatted metrics
- Custom metrics for business operations (transaction success rate, inventory levels, etc.)

### Audit Trail

- All admin operations logged with user context
- Transaction history maintained in database
- Event history available through Kafka log compaction
- Notification history stored for compliance

---

## Data Consistency Model

### Synchronous Consistency (Strong)

Used for critical real-time operations:

- Inventory availability checks
- Payment processing
- Immediate transaction status

### Eventual Consistency (Asynchronous)

Used for non-critical updates:

- Stock level updates after dispensing
- Notification generation
- Audit log creation
- Reporting and analytics

### Conflict Resolution

- **Optimistic Locking**: Version fields on key entities
- **Idempotent Consumers**: ProcessedEvent table prevents duplicate processing
- **Event Ordering**: Single partition per topic ensures order
- **Manual Intervention**: Admin dashboard for conflict resolution

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

1. **Service Won't Start**

   - Check if Config Server is running
   - Verify Eureka Server is accessible
   - Ensure MySQL database exists and is accessible
   - Check Kafka broker is running

2. **Events Not Consumed**

   - Verify Kafka topics exist
   - Check consumer group configuration
   - Review ProcessedEvent table for duplicates
   - Check Kafka broker connectivity

3. **Authentication Failures**

   - Verify JWT token not expired (8-hour limit)
   - Check user exists in database and is active
   - Ensure correct password hash
   - Verify gateway routing configuration

4. **Slow Performance**
   - Check database connection pool exhaustion
   - Monitor JVM heap usage
   - Review Kafka consumer lag
   - Check for network latency

### Debug Tools

- **Eureka Dashboard**: Service registration status
- **Actuator Endpoints**: Health, metrics, and diagnostics
