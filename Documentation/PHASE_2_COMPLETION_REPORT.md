## Key Technical Insights

### Payment Service

- Configurable success rates enable realistic testing scenarios
- Separate sequences for cash (with change) and card payments
- Event-driven architecture allows async payment status updates

### Transaction Service

- SAGA orchestrator pattern prevents distributed transaction complexity
- Synchronous calls for real-time operations (availability, payment)
- Compensation logic handles partial failures gracefully
- State machine clearly defines transaction lifecycle

### Dispensing Service

- Hardware simulation with 94.5% success rate for realistic testing
- Multiple failure types (motor, sensor, jam, verification)
- 500-1000ms delay simulates real hardware operation
- Event-driven stock updates maintain inventory accuracy

### Notification Service

- Single service consumes all 5 Kafka topics for centralized alerting
- Alert classification enables priority-based handling
- Deduplication prevents duplicate notifications
- Acknowledgment tracking supports admin workflow

### API Gateway

- Single entry point simplifies security enforcement
- JWT validation occurs once at gateway (not in each service)
- User context headers eliminate repeated authentication
- Eureka integration enables dynamic routing

### Infrastructure

- Config Server uses local files (not Git) for simplicity
- Eureka provides service discovery without external dependencies
- Kafka single partition/replica suitable for local development
- Database-per-service enables independent service evolution
