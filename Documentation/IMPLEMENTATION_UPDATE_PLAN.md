## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas

#### 1. Kafka Migration (Phase 3)

**Risk**: Event loss or duplication during topic migration

**Mitigation**:

- Dual publishing to old and new topics (1 week overlap)
- Comprehensive monitoring during migration
- Automated rollback if issues detected
- Retain old topics for 30 days

**Contingency**: Revert to old topics, analyze issues, retry migration

---

#### 2. Database Migrations (Phase 2)

**Risk**: Schema changes cause downtime or data loss

**Mitigation**:

- Test migrations in staging environment
- Use backward-compatible changes only
- Run migrations during off-peak hours
- Full database backup before migration

**Contingency**: Restore from backup, analyze failure, fix migration script

---

#### 3. Performance Regression (Phase 3)

**Risk**: Synchronous HTTP calls slower than expected

**Mitigation**:

- Extensive load testing before production
- Circuit breakers prevent cascading slowdowns
- Monitor latency metrics in real-time
- Gradual rollout (10% â†’ 50% â†’ 100%)

**Contingency**: Revert to Kafka-based flow, optimize sync calls, retry

---

### Medium-Risk Areas

#### 4. Circuit Breaker Configuration (Phase 1)

**Risk**: Incorrect thresholds cause premature failures or slow recovery

**Mitigation**:

- Start with conservative thresholds
- Monitor circuit breaker metrics
- Tune based on production behavior

**Contingency**: Adjust thresholds via configuration, no code changes needed

---

#### 5. Refund Idempotency (Phase 2)

**Risk**: Duplicate refunds charge customers twice

**Mitigation**:

- Extensive idempotency testing
- Database unique constraints
- Transaction-level locking

**Contingency**: Manual refund reversal, fix idempotency bug, compensate customers

---

## Rollback Strategy

### General Rollback Procedure

1. **Identify Issue**: Monitor alerts and dashboards
2. **Assess Severity**: Critical (rollback immediately) vs. Non-critical (fix forward)
3. **Execute Rollback**: Revert to previous deployment
4. **Verify Stability**: Monitor for 1 hour post-rollback
5. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify what went wrong
6. **Fix & Retry**: Address issue, redeploy

### Phase-Specific Rollback Plans

#### Phase 1: Fault Tolerance

- **Action**: Remove circuit breaker annotations, redeploy
- **Time**: < 15 minutes
- **Impact**: Minimal (no data loss)

#### Phase 2: Refund System

- **Action**: Disable refund API, revert compensation logic
- **Time**: < 30 minutes
- **Impact**: Manual refunds required temporarily

#### Phase 3: Kafka Optimization

- **Action**: Revert to old topics, disable new consumers
- **Time**: < 30 minutes
- **Impact**: Higher latency, but functional

#### Phase 4: Saga Pattern

- **Action**: Disable saga orchestration, use direct refunds
- **Time**: < 20 minutes
- **Impact**: Less sophisticated compensation

#### Phase 5: Monitoring

- **Action**: Disable tracing, remove metrics
- **Time**: < 10 minutes
- **Impact**: Reduced visibility only
